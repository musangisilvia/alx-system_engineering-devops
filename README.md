## Shell Basics
Terminals are a link to shells.

## Shell Permissions
User, Group and Others can have permissions to read write or execute a file / directory

## Shell Redirections
Output of commands can be redirected to files.  Files can be used as input to commands.

## Shell, init files, variables and expansions
Working with variables and expansions on the shell.

## Loops, Conditions and Parsing
For and While loop in Shell Scripting.

## Processes and Signals
Process creation, killing processes. Signals such as SIGINT are also covered.

## Regular Expressions

A regular expression, commonly called a “regexp”, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.  It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command). While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.

## Networking Basics

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

- The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
- The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
The OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.
